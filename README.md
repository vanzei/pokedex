## üìä Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
The application includes built-in monitoring capabilities through Prometheus and can be visualized with Grafana dashboards.

Prometheus Metrics
Metrics are exposed at http://localhost:8080/metrics. The main metric is my_app_requests_total, which tracks API calls with method and path labels.

```
# HELP my_app_requests_total Total number of requests to my app
# TYPE my_app_requests_total counter
my_app_requests_total{method="GET",path="catch"} 12
my_app_requests_total{method="GET",path="cacheHit"} 45
my_app_requests_total{method="GET",path="explore"} 23
my_app_requests_total{method="GET",path="mapHit"} 8
my_app_requests_total{method="GET",path="pokedex"} 5
```
1. Setting up Grafana Dashboard
Make sure Prometheus is configured to scrape the application metrics:

```bash
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'pokedex'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
```
2. Create a Grafana dashboard with the following panels:

**API Calls by Type**: Shows the distribution of API calls
```
sum by (path) (my_app_requests_total)
```

**Cache Hit Ratio**: Shows the efficiency of the cache
```
sum(my_app_requests_total{path="cacheHit"}) / sum(my_app_requests_total)
```

**API Calls by Type**: Shows requests per second
```
rate(my_app_requests_total[1m])
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
Command Structure: Clean separation of concerns with individual command files
API Client: Efficient client for the PokeAPI with proper error handling
Custom Cache: Time-based eviction cache to reduce API load
Metrics Collection: Prometheus integration for monitoring API usage
OpenTelemetry: Distributed tracing for advanced troubleshooting
## üìö Implementation Details
The application uses:

Go's built-in concurrency for background cache eviction
Custom HTTP client with timeouts and context support
Prometheus counters for API metrics
Math/rand for Pokemon catch probability calculations
JSON marshaling/unmarshaling for data serialization
## üß† Behind the Catch Mechanics
The probability of catching a Pokemon is inversely proportional to its base experience:

This means:

A Pokemon with base experience 50 has ~12.5% difficulty (87.5% catch rate)
A Pokemon with base experience 300 has 75% difficulty (25% catch rate)
Legendary Pokemon (360+ base exp) are capped at 90% difficulty (10% catch rate)
